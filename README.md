# GLSL Shader

This repository contains personal shaders that are saved in a self-contained HTML-file
using the shaderboy library (and the shaderboy website) developed by ArielMant0.
Consequently, all source code is optimized for shaderboy.
Each shader has its own folder and description on how to use it.
